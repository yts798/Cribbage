# Cribbage Scoring and Logging Enhancement

This repository hosts the enhancements made to the Cribbage card game trainer developed by NERD Games. The main objective was to integrate a scoring system and a logging mechanism into the existing game trainer to track and evaluate gameplay performance.

It includes implementation of a scoring system according to the Cribbage rules, considering variations for future configurability.
